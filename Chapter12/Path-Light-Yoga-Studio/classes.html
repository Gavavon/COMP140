    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <dd>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with 
        palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly buty deeply. Sink into the mat and let your 
        worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to pust yourself 
        to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for 
        all that you have in your life. Namaste.</dd>
